        <h1>Dive sites of the Similan Islands</h1>
        The Andaman Sea consists of many beautiful tropical islands, covered with dense forest and surrounded by white sandy beaches with crystal-clear waters. The area offers a variety of different dive sites, from deep rock formations with a spectacular array of pelagic schools to gentle coral gardens featuring a bright mass of colour and a large number of different reef fish.
